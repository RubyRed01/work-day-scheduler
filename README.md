# work-day-scheduler

This project is where I create a schedule template for the average 9-5 working day.

There will be a date displayed at the top and timeblocks below that span from 9AM to 5PM, each containing a text area for writing down events which can be saved to the local storage.

Here being displayed is the webpage containing the date and heading at the top, and below are the time blocks (they are all grey because I was accessing it at 11pm).

Here is me writing an event and having clicked the save button.

And finally here is my event being saved into the local storage.
