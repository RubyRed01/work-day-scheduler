WORK-DAY-SCHEDULER

- Current day will display at top (Monday, January 1st e.g)
- Timeblocks with standard business hours are displayed when scrolling down the page (9am to 5pm)
- Each timeblock will be colour coded indicating whether it's in the past, present or future (grey for past, red for current timeblock, green for future)
- Clicking on the timeblock allows the user to add/update an event
- There will be a save button to the right hand side for saving the timeblock's event into local storage
- The saved event should still persist after the page has refreshed


    - Creating columns as the structure of the timeblocks

    - Insert text boxes into the middle columns

    - Insert buttons into the end columns
       [these buttons will then function to save the timeblock data into the local storage]
